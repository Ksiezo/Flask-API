# Flask-API
My first API using Flask, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Python 3.7. The Project consists of exploring the design of REST api and adding functionalities to the app.py file. 

Updates

12/16/2018 Created project and made first test run of getting the rest api to show data in the local host through function AskNumbers.
            Next objective is to give a purpose to the API and add functionality. Then after, a thorough explanation of how it all works.
